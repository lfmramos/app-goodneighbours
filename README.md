## About the application
Mão Amiga is a platform created to bring elderly people together with volunteers ready to help with small everyday tasks, such as shopping, making small repairs around the house or even offering company for a cup of tea or a walk.
We believe in the power of community and the importance of caring for those who have contributed so much to the world we know today.
More than providing help, we want to promote solidarity, mutual support and, especially, create bonds that make a difference.

## Our Vision

We want to build an intergenerational support network where every senior can find the help they need quickly, safely and in affordable conditions.
Our vision is to eliminate the isolation and difficulties faced by the elderly in everyday tasks while cultivating values of empathy and collaboration in people with time on their hands.
Our ultimate goal is for our seniors to feel supported and respected.

## How it works

1. Registration: Volunteers register for free on the platform, creating their profile with the information requested;
2. Profile: After registering, a card will be available with only the information needed by those who are going to ask for help, such as name, location and tasks the volunteer proposes to do;
3. Request for Help: Elderly people and institutions can submit requests for help according to the profiles displayed, selecting according to the tasks of interest and location;
4. Connection with Volunteers and Confirmation: After the elderly person or institution selects the profile of interest, the volunteer contacts the elderly person directly to confirm the details and arrange the best date and time to carry out the task.

## Why We Started

The idea for this application was born from living directly with the reality of many elderly people, either through professional experiences or through the experience of some members of the group with family members who live far away and often have no one around.
These stories touched us deeply and inspired us to create a practical and accessible solution during the 'Make IT Real' challenge of the Code for All_ bootcamp.
We believe that every gesture, no matter how small, can transform someone's life and that no one should have to face everyday challenges alone.
